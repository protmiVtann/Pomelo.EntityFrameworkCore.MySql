The book is divided into four parts, each containing several chapters. The first part deals with the principles of gnosis and the secrets of the letters and numbers. The second part explains the virtues and properties of the planets, stars, and constellations. The third part describes the methods and techniques of making talismans, amulets, and seals for various ends. The fourth part contains various forms of divination, such as geomancy, palmistry, and dream interpretation.
 
The book is widely regarded as a masterpiece of Sufi literature and a treasure of Islamic culture. It has been translated into several languages, including Persian, Turkish, Urdu, and French. However, some scholars have criticized the book for its heterodox views and its reliance on occult sciences that are considered forbidden or dubious in mainstream Islam. The book has also been banned or censored in some countries for its controversial content.
 
Despite these challenges, the book remains a source of inspiration and guidance for many Sufis and seekers of spiritual knowledge. It is also a valuable document for the study of Islamic history, culture, and thought.

One of the most fascinating aspects of the book is its use of numerology and symbolism to reveal the hidden meanings and connections between the divine names, the Quranic verses, the prophetic traditions, and the natural phenomena. The author employs various methods of calculation and interpretation, such as abjad, isopsephy, gematria, and notarikon, to derive mystical insights and secrets from the sacred texts and the cosmic order. He also uses diagrams, tables, charts, and figures to illustrate his points and to facilitate the understanding of his readers.
 
Another remarkable feature of the book is its comprehensive and detailed treatment of the occult sciences and their applications. The author provides instructions and examples on how to make and use various kinds of talismans, amulets, and seals for protection, healing, love, wealth, success, and other worldly and spiritual goals. He also explains the rules and ethics of magic and warns against its misuse and abuse. He also discusses the benefits and dangers of astrology, alchemy, and divination, and offers advice on how to practice them safely and wisely.
 
The book is not only a theoretical exposition of Sufi doctrine and practice, but also a practical guide for spiritual seekers who wish to attain gnosis and closeness to God. The author emphasizes the importance of sincerity, devotion, purification, and remembrance in the path of Sufism. He also teaches various methods of meditation, contemplation, invocation, and recitation that can help the seeker achieve higher states of consciousness and awareness. He also shares his personal experiences and visions that he attained through his spiritual journey.
